## What is Scrivener?

Scrivener is a professional writing tool that empowers authors, researchers, and storytellers to bring their ideas to life. Unlike standard word processors, Scrivener provides a structured environment where you can outline, draft, and revise your work without losing sight of the big picture.

The application is built around the concept of a “project”—a container for all your text drafts, research files, notes, and metadata. You can easily navigate between chapters, scenes, or sections using the binder, and visualize your narrative flow with the corkboard and outliner.

Scrivener also includes powerful composition tools such as Scrivenings mode, which lets you view multiple documents as one, and Snapshots, which allow you to save and compare different versions of your text. Whether you're writing a novel, a script, a thesis, or a report, Scrivener adapts to your workflow and helps you stay organized from the first idea to the final draft.

With support for rich text, images, PDFs, and more, Scrivener is the go-to solution for writers who need more than a basic text editor. It’s trusted by best-selling authors, academics, and journalists worldwide for its flexibility, depth, and reliability.
